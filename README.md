READ ME IN PROGRESS!
This project is meant to be a replacement for my portfolio (http://www.tonyebrown.com). My current portfolio, while nice, is a few years old now and needs some love.

_Even worse, it doesn't contain as much React and SASS as I'd like, and doesn't show off my newest bestest skills. I'd heard a lot about Gatsby ([official Website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)) and decided to give it a go._


## ðŸš€ Inspiration and Technologies used 

1.  **Inspiration**

    Many many beautiful portfolios on Awwwards. Also found some amazing ideas via my favorite web roundup from the folks tympanus.net / @codrops. 
    
    I almost forgot, the amazing Gatsby docs will take you very far! 

    ```shell
    # "Itâ€™s not where you take things from - itâ€™s where you take them to."
    - Jean-Luc Godard
    ```

1.  **Technologies used**

    I'm using most (if not all) of my favorite libraries - React, SASS, Gatsby, React Spring, GraphQL, Bootstrap, etc.

    ```shell
    # "Imitation is not just the sincerest form of flattery - it's the sincerest form of learning."
    - George Bernard Shaw
    ```

1.  **Quick stop for me**

    Local portfolio site running on `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._





Thanks for visiting, and thanks for reading.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
